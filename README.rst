facilitate writing complex XPath queries from Python code.

Generating expressions
----------------------

To create expressions, use the generators in |xpath.dsl|_::

    from xpath import dsl as x
    from xpath.renderer import to_xpath

    expression = x.descendant("ul")[x.attr("id") == "foo"]
    xpath = to_xpath(expression)

.. |xpath.dsl| replace:: ``xpath.dsl``
.. _xpath.dsl: https://github.com/elliterate/xpath.py/blob/master/xpath/dsl.py

HTML
----

XPath comes with a set of premade XPaths for use with HTML documents.

You can generate these like this::

    from xpath.html import button
    from xpath.renderer import to_xpath

    to_xpath(button("Save"), exact=True)

See |xpath.html|_ for all available matchers.

.. |xpath.html| replace:: ``xpath.html``
.. _xpath.html: https://github.com/elliterate/xpath.py/blob/master/xpath/html.py
